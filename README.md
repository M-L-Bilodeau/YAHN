YAHN (You Are Here Now) is a calm, welcoming digital space designed to remind people of one simple truth: you made it. This project is the visual and emotional beginning of a broader mission to build supportive peer communities—online and in person—grounded in presence, empathy, and resilience. The homepage reflects this with gentle motion, soft gradients, and a message that welcomes visitors exactly as they are. Future development will include peer support features, AI-enhanced moderation, and local resource integration, all centered on kindness and connection.
